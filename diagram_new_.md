# Organizational Models
  
## 1. High-Volume ASC Model (HIGH vertical integration with 40 total referring ODs)

## 3. Least-Profitable Model (No ASC, low-volume, low vertical integration, 2 referring ODs)

# Strategic Priorities for US Eye
  
**Strategic Priority 1: Preserve and Expand Vertically Integrated Model 1**
- Maintain high-volume surgeon-to-ASC pipelines.
- Ensure robust OD referral base (target: 5-10 ODs per surgeon, including internal and external).
- Retain ownership and control of ASCs (major revenue driver and ensures efficient operations)
- Focus on premium service lines (e.g., premium IOLs and refractive cataract surgery).
  
**Strategic Priority 2: Protect Patient Experience and Community Goodwill**
- Avoid cuts that affect the quality of care or trust in local markets.
- Sustain surgeon and OD satisfaction to retain high referral volumes.
- Maintain and improve brand reputation in all regions
  
**Strategic Priority 3: Cut Costs and Drive Synergies (The Private Equity Approach), BUT Without Undermining Priorities 1 and 2**
- Consolidate support services and reduce redundancyâ€”but not at the expense of surgical throughput or patient satisfaction.
- Be selective in acquisition strategy: avoid practices that structurally diverge from Model 1 unless a clear integration plan is set.
- Control number of outstanding shares and debt levels; acquisitions should enhance, not dilute, per-share earnings.

# Growth Risk Warning
  
**Acquisition of lower-performing models (Model 2 and 3) may:**
- Dilute earnings per share.
- Increase leverage in a high-interest-rate environment.
- Reduce overall profitability and revenue growth unless tightly integrated post-acquisition.
